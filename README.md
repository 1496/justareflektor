This is the repository of the "Just A Reflektor" client side source developed by Google Labs, AATOAA Inc. and UNIT9 Ltd.

The source is not including third party libraries so will require some work to get up and running - and is provided primarily to consult not to rebuild the application.

### Tech Page

The Google Labs team have created a self standing module which can be found in 'app/tech' that should be complete and an easy installation to perform experiments with some of the site code.
