This is the repository of the "Just A Reflektor" client side source developed by Google Labs, AATOAA Inc. and UNIT9 Ltd.

The source is not including third party libraries so will require some work to get up and running - and is provided primarily to consult not to rebuild the application.

### Tech Page

The Google Labs team have created a self standing module which can be found in 'app/tech' that should be complete and an easy installation to perform experiments with some of the site code.

### Building front end

Desktop and mobile projects are designed to be independent. They do not share any code and can be freely modified without risk of affecting one another.
```
client/app/src/desktop
```
and
```
client/app/src/mobile
```

Both desktop and mobile projects are set up using Grunt (http://gruntjs.com/).

First, you need to install all development dependencies. To do this, enter either desktop or mobile source folder and run the below command (only once per development machine):
```
sudo npm install
```

If you do not have Grunt installed, you may need to install it first:
```
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```
and / or install it locally to your project with the following command:
```
sudo npm install grunt --save-dev
```

Then you can already build the project:
```
grunt release
```

To build development version (not minified), run:
```
grunt debug
```

If you plan longer development, run a watcher task that will keep building required parts of the project as you save modified files:
```
grunt watch
```
